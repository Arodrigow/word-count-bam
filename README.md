## Project - Unique Word Counter

A linguistics company asked me to build them a **Unique Word Counter** to automate their quotation process.So, this project consists three steps:

- **Form**: responsible for receiving a text file, or plain text, and sending it to the back-end;
- **Validation**: checks the file or text for data errors;
- **Processing**: counts the quantity of unique words in the given data;
- **Response**: if the process was sucessful, the response contains the quotation value linked to the unique word count.

## Technologies

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). I was interested in toying with Next for quite some time, and saw this project as a oportunity to learn about it, there was no real technical reason to use it.

**NOTE:** The rates used on this dev build **DO NOT** reflect the real values used by the company.
